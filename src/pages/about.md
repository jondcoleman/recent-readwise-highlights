A simple way to view your most recent 100 Readwise highlights, sorted newest to oldest, not grouped by their source.

### Why I Created This App:

I was looking for a simple way to quickly scan all of my highlights from the last couple of weeks, ordered by recency. Readwise only provides a view, grouped by source. Their reviews feature can be used to surface recent highlights if adjusted, but I like to reserve that for re-surfacing older highlights.

### How It Works:

Using the app is simple. Just [retrieve your API token from Readwise](https://readwise.io/access_token) and save it in the app. I take your privacy seriously, so I made sure the app securely stores your token in a cookie in your browser, never on the server. If you ever need to remove it, you can easily do so by clearing your browser's cookies.
